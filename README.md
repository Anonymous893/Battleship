# Battleship

This is a simple Battleship game developed using Java and utilises object oriented programming concepts. The game is played between two players and each player places their fleet of ships on a 10 x 10 board. The objective is to sink all of the opponent's ships.

##### Rules
At the beginning of the game, a board with the random placement of the five ships will be generated. Each player has a board showing their hits and misses on their opponent’s ships.

A _0_ represents an unattacked spot. 

Both players will take turns to enter their coordinates in the format of A1. The left character is a capital letter from A to J while the right character is a number from 1 to 10.

As the game progresses, the board will begin to change in response to the coordinates picked by the player. 

A _1_ represents a missed attack while a _2_ represents a hit.
